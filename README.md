# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in OpenGL (C++)
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) in C++. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Features
1. Graphical user interface using OpenGL for rendering.
2. Mouse input for player interaction.

## Prerequisites
1. OpenGL (FreeGLUT) library installed on your system.
2. C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ files using a C++ compiler.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Game Controls
1. Click on an empty square to place your mark (X or O).
2. The game alternates between players until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
